 <p>
  Smoking is considered a daily habit for many people. You may have become accustomed to smoking a cigarette with your morning coffee, or during a break at work, or on your way home at the end of a busy day, or perhaps your friends, family, or colleagues smoke in front of you, so this has become part of the way with which you deal with them. Smoking contains the chemical nicotine, which in turn causes addiction. The body and mind quickly become accustomed to this substance, and people usually start smoking for various reasons, including: enhancing self-image and presenting a more confident image to the interviewer. Smoking can also be a way to adapt to... Depression, anxiety, or even boredom, or reducing the feeling of constant hunger, especially for those who suffer from excess weight.
